## 🍑 vs 🫓: Why Choose ASS?

| Feature           | ASS (Autoscaling Server Service) | AWS (A Wallet Sucker) | DigitalOcean (Droplet Drown) | Kubernetes (Komplicated Mess) | DIY (Disaster It Yourself) |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scaling Speed     | Dummy Thicc                      | Slower than my ex    | Like watching paint dry      | Eventually... maybe           | What's scaling?            |
| Reliability       | Tight like yoga pants            | 99.9% of the time    | Hope you can swim            | Depends on your YAML skills   | Pray to the server gods    |
| Performance       | Bouncy and responsive            | Pay more to go fast  | Floats when not sinking      | Lost in a sea of pods         | As good as your hardware   |
| Customer Support  | We've got your backside 24/7     | "Have you tried AWS docs?" | "Here's a floatie"     | Stack Overflow is your friend | You're on your own, buddy  |
| Meme Potential    | Over 9000                        | Jeff Bezos' piggy bank | Wet memes only            | YAML indentation jokes        | Unlimited (mostly tears)   |
| Cost              | Thicc value for your buck        | Hope you like ramen  | Affordable until you scale   | Hidden costs everywhere       | Your sanity + $$           |
| Setup Time        | Faster than you can say "ASS"    | Slower than a sloth  | Drowning in droplets         | "It's been 84 years..."       | How's your weekend looking? |

Remember: With ASS, there's no need to clench - we keep it tight so you don't have to. Why settle for less when you can have a piece of ASS?

## 📐 Architecture

Our architecture is THICC. Trust us, you'll really want to dive right in.

## 🚫 What ASS is NOT

- Not Kubernetes (because who needs that many syllables?)
- Not written in fake languages like "Go" or "Java" (we use REAL languages like THICC++ and ASSembly)
- Not a joke (okay, maybe a little)
