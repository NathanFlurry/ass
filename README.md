|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scaling Speed     | Dummy Thicc                      | Slower than my ex    | Like watching paint dry      | Eventually... maybe           | What's scaling?            |
| Reliability       | Tight like yoga pants            | 99.9% of the time    | Hope you can swim            | Depends on your YAML skills   | Pray to the server gods    |
| Performance       | Bouncy and responsive            | Pay more to go fast  | Floats when not sinking      | Lost in a sea of pods         | As good as your hardware   |
| Customer Support  | We've got your backside 24/7     | "Have you tried AWS docs?" | "Here's a floatie"     | Stack Overflow is your friend | You're on your own, buddy  |

Remember: With ASS, there's no need to clench - we keep it tight so you don't have to. Why settle for less when you can have a piece of ASS?

## 📐 Architecture

Our architecture is THICC. Trust us, you'll really want to dive right in.

## 🚫 What ASS is NOT

- Not Kubernetes (because who needs that many syllables?)
- Not written in fake languages like "Go" or "Java" (we use REAL languages like THICC++ and ASSembly)
- Not a joke (okay, maybe a little)
